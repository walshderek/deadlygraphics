## Purpose  
Deadly Graphics (DG) is an evolving suite of AI-driven development tools  
designed for automation, self-maintaining codebases, and rich documentation.  

DG provides:

- Cross-platform WSL/Windows syncing  
- Tools that document and modify themselves  

DG aims to feel like a *living code ecosystem*.

## DG_vibecoder's Role  
Vibecoder is the automation heart of DG.  
It handles:  
- Patch-based code editing  
- Full repository snapshots  
- GitHub mirroring  
- Safe reversible updates  
- Self-maintained documentation  

Developers **never edit core tools manually** — the overseer manages everything.
