# The Ethical Arts Council Manifesto

## The Problem
The current funding model for British independent film is broken. Creators rely on donations (Kickstarter) with zero return for the donor, or massive studio funding that strips away creative rights.

## The Vision
Deadly Graphics proposes a "Micro-Patronage" model:
1.  **Investment, Not Donation:** A £10 contribution is an investment. If the project succeeds, the investor sees a return, verified by smart contracts.
2.  **The "1p" Principle:** Even a penny of profit share validates the supporter's belief in the art. It changes the relationship from "charity" to "partnership."
3.  **Pro-Bono Legal Verification:** We utilize AI to scaffold legal contracts, which are then reviewed by human legal professionals paid via the project's funding. This ensures compliance without the crushing upfront costs of traditional media law.

## The Goal
To create a self-sustaining loop where British audiences fund British talent, and share in the financial success of the work they support.
