# The Ethical Arts Council Manifesto

## The Problem
The current production model for independent film often forces a compromise between visual fidelity and creative control. High-end visuals typically require massive studio infrastructure, which dilutes the original vision.

## The Vision
Deadly Graphics proposes a "Sovereign Creator" model:
1.  **Local Control:** We prioritize local, offline AI stacks (Diamond Stack) over cloud APIs to ensure no third party can pull the plug on a project.
2.  **AI as Crew:** We utilize AI not to replace the artist, but to act as a virtual crew, allowing a single director to execute a vision that previously required hundreds of people.
3.  **Ethical Fidelity:** We commit to the "Deadly" standard—using AI to enhance and polish, ensuring the output meets the highest definitions of visual excellence.

## The Goal
To create a self-sustaining studio where British talent can produce world-class animation and visual effects without leaving the country or selling out their IP.
