# Deadly Graphics

**Deadly Graphics** is an AI-leveraged film studio and technical platform with a dual-meaning mission statement:

> **"Deadly"** (Adjective, Irish Slang): Excellent, brilliant, fantastic, or "cool."
> **"Graphics"** (Noun, Industry Term): The highest standard of visual fidelity and technical performance.

We are building a system to democratize high-end visual storytelling (Deadly Graphics) while ensuring the business model itself is "Deadly" (Excellent) for the creators and investors involved.

## The Mission
To build a sustainable ecosystem where:
1.  **Creatives** get funded without losing creative control.
2.  **Audiences** become investors (Micro-Patrons), not just consumers.
3.  **Legal & Ethics** are baked into the production pipeline via AI-assisted QC.

## The Tech Stack ("The Rig")
We operate on a custom high-performance Linux (WSL2) environment running on NVIDIA RTX hardware.
* **ComfyUI:** Node-based workflow for complex visual generation.
* **OneTrainer:** Fine-tuning base models for consistent character/style LoRAs.
* **AI-Toolkit:** Rapid training for flux-based assets.
